# -VR1Family Charity Aid Services - IT System Pilot Project
Project Overview
VR1Family, a global charity organization, aims to develop a new IT system to address the inefficiencies of their current system, which is causing an overhead of 30% of financial donations. The new system's primary goal is to reduce operational costs to under 10%, thus freeing up 20% of the funds for direct aid services. The organization plans to launch a pilot case study for this new IT system in Australia.

Business Case
The new IT system will streamline aid distribution, provide better visibility and control over inventory, and improve overall operational efficiency. The system will enable data capture from aid recipients and donors, facilitate efficient requisition and distribution of aid, and support visualized data tracking. This project is critical to reducing overhead costs and improving the impact of the charity's operations.

Risks Identified
User Interface Complexity: The new system's UI might be challenging for the primarily retired volunteer staff, leading to delays in adoption and project delivery. Extra time and resources may be needed to simplify the UI, potentially impacting the project's budget and schedule.

System Security: Given the distributed nature of the organization, the new system could be vulnerable to hacking attempts, which might lead to privacy breaches and additional costs for enhanced security measures.

Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Models Considered
Scrum Model:

Advantages: Effective for managing complex projects through iterative development, frequent feedback, and team collaboration.
Disadvantages: Requires a high level of expertise and familiarity with the Scrum process, which may increase learning time and costs. Daily meetings may be impractical for the largely volunteer-based workforce.
Waterfall Model:

Advantages: Suitable for small projects with clear requirements. Easy to manage with distinct stages, making it ideal for teams with less experience in software development.
Disadvantages: Inflexible to changes once a stage is completed, and the sequential process could delay the project if modifications are needed later on.
Functional Areas and Use Cases
Data Capture: Interfaces for capturing general and private information of aid recipients and donors.
Information Setup for Aid Items: Creation and tracking of aid categories and items, including inventory management.
Aid Receiving and Distribution: Interfaces for managing aid requisition and receipt processes.
Optical Character Recognition Support: Integration of OCR for processing handwritten aid requests.
Dashboard View: A dashboard for monitoring aid distribution and inventory status.
Social Media Integration: Features for promoting the organization through social media.
Security Considerations: Secure hosting and login attempt restrictions to protect the system from unauthorized access.
Print and Email Support: Functionality for printing documents and sending email notifications.
Text to Speech Integration: Support for speech-to-text conversion for aid requisition.
Administrator User: A dedicated admin user role with access to all functionalities and the dashboard.
